      <h2>About Snowrift Interactive</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, my name is Linus — I’m the person behind Snowrift Interactive. I live in Sweden and have been working in IT for nearly a decade, mostly in support and system administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve been playing games my whole life and always thought it would be fun to try making one of my own someday. Now I finally am. Snowrift is just me, working on this in the evenings and weekends, learning as I go and building the kinds of games I’d want to play myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t have any formal education in game development, art, or design — just a lot of curiosity and a willingness to figure things out along the way. I'm using Unity, C#, and Blender to build the game piece by piece, while also planning to purchase a few assets to help speed things up and focus on what matters most.
        </p>
        <p>
          The focus is on atmosphere, storytelling, and meaningful experiences — sometimes quiet and slow, sometimes strange or unsettling, but always made with care. Thanks for stopping by.
        </p>
