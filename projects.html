      <h2>Current Project</h2>
<p>
  I'm building a slow-burning, narrative-driven horror game focused on exploration, atmosphere, and survival without combat. 
  You play as someone who finds themselves trapped in a place with a dark history, slowly unraveling the truth behind disturbing experiments and failed subjects. 
  It’s a quiet, tense experience where small details matter—environmental storytelling, scattered notes, and audio logs guide you through the unknown.
</p>

<p>
  There’s no title yet, and the project is still early in development, but it’s growing piece by piece.<br>
  <strong>Keep an eye on Steam and my socials for updates and a future release date.</strong>

          <p><strong>Visual direction shifted</strong> from PSX-style to a more realistic, atmospheric look — though this may evolve further. Concept art for enemies and their behaviors continued, alongside work on pacing and worldbuilding. Early systems like inventory and key/door interaction were prototyped and tested. Ideas for studio identity and the game’s online presence began to take shape.</p>

          <p>The website is now live. Story development has deepened with more refined narrative threads and character backstories. Additional concept art is in progress, and enemy behavior is being iterated on. Internal tools for level layout and scene flow are also being tested to help speed up the building process moving forward.</p>
