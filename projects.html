      <h2>Current Project</h2>
      <p>
        I'm building a slow-burning, narrative-driven horror game focused on exploration, atmosphere, and survival without combat. 
        You play as someone who finds themselves trapped in a place with a dark history, slowly unraveling the truth behind disturbing experiments and failed subjects.
        <br><br>
        There’s no title yet, and the project is still early in development, but it’s growing piece by piece.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Keep an eye on Steam and my socials for updates and a future release date.</strong>

      <h3><strong>Project Setup & First Prototype</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Focused on structure and gameplay basics.</strong> Established the Unity project foundation, defined the narrative direction, and outlined core mechanics. Early concepts for enemies and story beats were created. A playable prototype with basic movement and door/key interaction was implemented.</p>

      <h3><strong>Visual Direction & Early Systems</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Visual style shifted and systems emerged.</strong> Moved from a PSX-style aesthetic to a more realistic and atmospheric tone (still evolving). Developed concept art and behavior ideas for enemies. Prototyped early systems like inventory and interactions. Brainstormed studio identity and online presence.</p>

      <p><strong>Online presence established, story deepened.</strong> The Snowrift website is now live. Narrative threads and character backstories expanded. More concept art in development, and internal tools for layout and scene structure are being tested to support efficient progress moving forward.</p>
