            Focused on setting up the project structure in Unity, establishing the narrative direction, and outlining the core mechanics. Initial enemy concepts and story beats were defined, along with the first playable prototype featuring movement and door/key interaction.

            Visual direction shifted from PSX-style to a more realistic, atmospheric look—though this may evolve further. Concept art for enemies and their behaviors continued, alongside work on pacing and worldbuilding. Early systems like inventory and key/door interaction were prototyped and tested. Ideas for studio identity and online presence also began taking form.

            The website is now live. Story development has deepened with refined narrative threads and character backstories. Additional concept art is in progress, and enemy behavior is being iterated on. Internal tools for level layout and scene flow are also being tested to speed up the building process.
